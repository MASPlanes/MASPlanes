# Mechanism used by the planes to evaluate the cost of performing tasks.
#
#   independent-distance    The cost of performing a task is the distance
#                             between the plane and the task. This strategy does
#                             not take into account any other tasks that the
#                             plane also has to complete.

#                           The cost of performing a task is the distance

#                             not have enough battery, the distance to the

# in range bid for all the tasks of their neighbors. Finally, two tenths of s
# (steps) after the auctions began, the owner plane chooses a winner for each
# of its tasks (which may be itself). In case the winner is another plane, it
# transfers the ownership of that task to the new owner.
